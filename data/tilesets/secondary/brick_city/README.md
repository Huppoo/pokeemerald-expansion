## Brick City
This tileset is derived from Ekat99's "Brick City" tileset on [DeviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/ekat99/art/Brick-City-895740356), originally designed for use with Pokemon Essentials.

From DeviantArt:
"This is a public use tileset for non-commercial projects. It has been specifically designed for RPG Maker, making it perfect for anyone using a gen 3 style with their project in Pokémon Essentials. If used, please give credit to:

1. Ekat
2. Vurtax (FRLG Rips)
3. Heartlessdragoon (RSE Rips)
4. Alistar (tree bases and short grass patches)
5. Slimshady (mailboxes)"

Imported to pokeemerald by Kumatora. This was a quick and dirty import for TARC, so there's likely a better way to organize metatiles, divvy up palettes, and add the tiles themselves, if anyone wishes to update it.
